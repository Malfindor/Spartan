Spartan Training Bot

Spartan is a very rudimentary bot-like program that can be used to practice offensive security.
Once enabled, it will periodically check various locations for compromises and suspicious activity.
Activity is randomized, with many random checks, simulating human error on the defensive end, but can be scaled through difficulty levels.

Installation instructions:

1) Run install.sh as root
That's it

Controller will be located at /bin/spartan, and can be called with the "spartan" command from the terminal.
